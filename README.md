# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health data using a machine learning model trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is **`diabetes.csv`**, containing 768 entries and 8 features related to health metrics:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

The target variable is `Outcome` (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes).

---

## ðŸ§  Model Used

A **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier is used for training the model, along with data scaling using `StandardScaler`.

Model training was done in a Jupyter Notebook, and the final trained model was exported as:

- `diabetes_model.pkl`
- `scaler.pkl`
